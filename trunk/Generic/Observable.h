/** Observable Interface
 
 NOTE: We do not recommend using this interface directly.  Rather, we
 will keep this class here as a sort of template to follow.  Instead,
 one should define new Observer / Observable classes, for example:
 Model / ModelObserver.  The declartion of Model and ModelObserver might then
 look like:

 class Model {
 public:
	virtual void registerObserver(ModelObserver* o);
	virtual void removeObserver(ModelObserver* o);
	virtual void notifyObservers();
 };
 
 class ModelObserver {
 public:
	virtual void update(Model* o) = 0;
 };
 
 A concrete class, say Foo, that wants observe Model would then implement
 the ModelObserver interface.  Say Foo also wanted to be an observer of
 the Simulation class.  We would then define another interface
 SimulationObserver.  Foo would then implement update(Model* o) and
 update(Simulation* o) and the compiler will take care of making
 sure the correct update method is called.
 
 If we had decided to directly use the Observable/Observer interface, the
 class Foo would implement only update(Observable* o), but then the update
 method would have to use dynamic casting to determine which of the two
 Observable classes actually called update.  This is very poor programming
 practice.
